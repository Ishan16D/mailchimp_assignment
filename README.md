# Mailchimp Assignment

Thank you for your consideration! Here you will find a brief overview of how to use my project.

## Dependencies

The only required package for this to work is numpy.

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
Example usage with the input.txt file

```bash
python main.py
Please enter the filename with extension you would like to test:input.txt
```

## Available inputs

The inputs folder has five available files to test. Two (input and test) which were provided by the assignment and three (bigger_input, comma, and input_with_char) which I created to test different cases.

- bigger_input.txt is 1MB in size
- comma.txt uses commas rather than tabs as delimiters
- input_with_char includes a word instead of a number

## Expected behavior

```bash
python main.py 
Please enter the filename with extension you would like to test:input.txt
The first checksum is 41919
